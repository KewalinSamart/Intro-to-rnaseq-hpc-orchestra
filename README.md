## Introduction to RNA-seq using high-performance computing (HPC)

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 2-day Introduction to RNA-sequencing data analysis workshop. This workshop focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement an RNA-seq data analysis workflow. It includes an introduction to shell (bash) and shell scripting. In addition to running the RNA-seq workflow from FASTQ files to count data, the workshop covers best practice guidlelines for RNA-seq experimental design and data organization/management.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.
